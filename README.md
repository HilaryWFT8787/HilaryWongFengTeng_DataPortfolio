## SLQ Project about Analyzing Students' Mental Health

This project description is sourced from DataCampâ€™s project on mental health of students going to a university in a different country. DataCamp is an online platform offering data science and data analysis courses and projects. The original project can be found there:

_Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards._

_The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression._

_Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor._

## Data Table Schema
The data table schema is presented as followed:

With that, the dataset's column descriptions provided valuable information for me in this investigation.

## The Task
Return a table with nine observations and five columns summarizing data for the international students: `stay`, `count_int`, `average_phq`, `average_scs`, and `average_as`, **in that order**. The average columns should contain the average of the `todep`, `tosc`, and `toas` columns for each length of stay, **rounded to two decimal places**. The `count_int` column should be the number of _international students_ for each length of stay. Sort the results by the length of stay in **descending order**.

## Data Exploration
In every data project, it is typical to explore the data to gain better understanding of the data. Henceforth, I had executed a SQL statement to view the dataset and the following table was created:
```
SELECT * 
FROM students;
```
