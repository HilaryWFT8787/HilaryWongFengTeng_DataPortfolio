**Project about Analyzing Students' Mental Health**

The project description is sourced from DataCampâ€™s project on mental health of students going to a university in a different country. DataCamp is an online platform offering data science and data analysis courses and projects. The original project can be found there:

_Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards._

_The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression._

_Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor._
